Game: 3-14

 

Gameplay: 3-14 is a 2-player turn-based game. Initially there is a pile of 9 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each player takes turn to choose a number from the pile. After a number is chosen, it will be removed from the pile and inserted into the player’s hand. The game ends when a player wins or when it is a draw game that the last number is chosen by the player who does not win.

 

Winning Condition: A player wins the game if the player’s hand contains 3 numbers whose sum is 14.

For example, if a player’s hand contains 1,4,8:

if the player chooses 2 from the pile (if available), then the player’s hand becomes 1,2,4,8, and the player would win the game because 2+4+8=14
if the player chooses 5 from the pile (if available), then the player’s hand becomes 1,4,5,8, and the player still would win the game because 1+5+8=14
however, if the player chooses 6 from the pile (if available), then the player’s hand becomes 1,4,6,8, but the player would not win because all possible sums of 3 numbers are not equal to 14 (1+4+6=11, 1+4+8=13, 1+6+8=15, 4+6+8=18). The fact that 6+8=14 is irrelevant because the sum must be obtained from exactly 3 numbers.
 

To Do: Write a program that

reads some input data indicating the status of a game
contains an AI algorithm to make a move for the current player by choosing a number from the pile and try to achieve the winning condition
output the updated status of the game
 

Input: The input should be read from the standard input stream that contains a sequence of numbers separated by space. The first number indicates how many moves have been made by the 2 players in total. The subsequent numbers represent the moves, i.e., the numbers that have been chosen by the 2 players. The following shows an example input:

4 5 2 6 3

In the above example, 4 moves have been made. Player 1 first chooses 5 from the pile; player 2 chooses 2; player 1 chooses 6; player 2 chooses 3. This means that player 1’s hand becomes 5, 6 and player 2’s hand becomes 2,3. The remaining numbers in the pile are thus 0,1,4,7,8. It is player 1’s turn. So given this input text file, your program should choose a number from 0,1,4,7,8 for player 1.

For a new game, there was no previous move. So the input just contains a single number 0.

 

Output: The output should have the exact format as the input, i.e., it should contain a sequence of numbers where the first number indicates how many moves have been made by the 2 players after you make the move. The subsequent numbers represent the moves that have been chosen by the players, with the last number indicating your move. For example, if you are given the above input and your program chooses 7 from the pile as your move, then the output should be shown as follows:

5 5 2 6 3 7

The output should be produced as the standard output stream.

 

Time Limit: Your program should generate the output within 2 minutes on any machine that runs your program.
